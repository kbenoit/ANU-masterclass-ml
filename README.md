## How to Use

### Cloning the repo

I recommend that you start by cloning the repository to your local system.  You can do this straight from RStudio, using "New Project", then from the New Project Wizard, select "Version Control" as the source, then "Git".  Paste "https://github.com/kbenoit/ANU-masterclass-ml" into the "Repository URL:" field.  Choose your preferred local parent directory from the bottom field.  Use the "Create Project" button to create the project and clone the repo locally.

### Refreshing the repo

You will be able to (and should) make local edits to the files that are in the repository.  But as these are updated, or as new files or solutions are added, you will want to pull these from the remote repository and update your local version.

The easiest way to do this is first to commit your local changes, from the Git panel in the Environment pane.  Once these are committed, you will be able to use the Pull button to get the newest versions.

### Subscribing to notifications 

To get notifications when there is an update, use the drop-down box from the left-most button from GitHub to choose "Watching".  (This assumes you have an account on GitHub, which you should have!)

## Setting up your computer for the exercises

This class involves exercises, and for you to set up for those, you will need to configure your own computer system.  To do this, you should have:

* Installed R 4.0.3.  Yes, you can use earlier versions, but why not use the latest?  If your major version is 3 or even earlier, you will have problems installing some of the packages we will be using.
* Installed [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
* Familiarised yourself with [cloning a Git repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
* Read about [how to use RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html).

This book is highly recommended for learning R the "tidyverse" way, which some machine learning as well:
